## CookE

Bangkit is a career readiness program that aims to produce high-caliber technical talent for world-class Indonesian technology companies and startups, fully supported by Google, GoTo, and Traveloka. At the end of the learning period, there is a capstone project that needs to be done as a final project. This project aims to create an application that implements every learning path in Bangkit, namely machine learning, mobile development, and cloud computing.

My group consists of 6 people and in this project we make a health-themed application. This application has 3 features, namely (1) searching for food recipes that contain nutritional content, (2) image recognition for fruits, vegetables and other ingredients which will display a description and nutritional content, and (3) a community feature where each people can share ideas or opinions.
Machine learning features are features number 1 and 2. The recipe feature uses a simple cosine similarity algorithm to match recipes and the image recognition feature uses tensorflow with transfer learning for training.
